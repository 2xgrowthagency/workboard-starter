# Task: <short title>

## Objective

State the outcome in plain language.

## Context

Include task-local context only: links to issues, docs, screenshots, examples, acceptance notes, and relevant prior decisions. Do not paste private memory, credentials, auth tokens, customer exports, or raw sensitive data.

## Scope

### In scope

- 

### Out of scope

- 

## Suggested starting points

- Target project ID:
- Target path:
- Repo/branch:
- Files likely involved:
- Related docs/issues:

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] 

## Required proof

- [ ] Current working directory and git branch/HEAD captured
- [ ] Commands/tests run, with result
- [ ] Diff/PR/commit link, if code changed
- [ ] Screenshot/browser proof, if UI-facing
- [ ] Autoreview/review result for non-trivial code changes, or reason skipped
- [ ] Caveats documented

## Stop and ask if

- A secret, account setting, billing setting, production data, destructive action, deployment, or ambiguous product decision is required.
- The target path/project does not match the registry.
- Acceptance criteria cannot be verified with the available tools.

## Orchestration notes

- Root/orchestrator claims and monitors; worker executes.
- Worker must not create subworkers unless this packet explicitly authorizes a bounded read-only swarm.
- Use medium worker reasoning unless this task explicitly justifies escalation.
- Keep all context task-local. No private memory dumps and no secrets.

## Status log

Use this format for every update:

```text

## Verification notes

Verifier fills this in during review.
